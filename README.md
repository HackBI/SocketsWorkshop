# SocketsWorkshop
Learn about sockets, which can send data between connections. 

Note: You will very likely need to understand beginner to intermediate java concepts to go to this workshop.

# Prerequisites
  1. A basic understanding of the java programming language
  2. An ide, such as eclipse, jgrasp, netbeans, or vscode.

# What we will cover
In this workshop, we cover a simple socket server which sends the date to clients that connect, an example of threads, and a combination of the two in the form of a tic-tac-toe game server. 

# Challenges after completing the workshop
  1. Make a game where the server generates a random number, and the client has to guess what that number is. 
  2. Create a texting app where multiple clients can chat with each other.
